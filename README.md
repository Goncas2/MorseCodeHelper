# MorseCodeHelper

My first Android project.

A simple app that produces Morse code from a single alphanumeric character or a sequence of characters, using audio and the smartphone's flashlight.

## Features:
- Click a button with a character and produce its Morse code
- Write a phrase and generate its Morse code, while also showing the generated code on-screen.
- In the settings menu, enable or disable the use of the flashlight or audio, and change the speed of the Morse code.
